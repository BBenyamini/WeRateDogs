#WeRateDogs

The main objective of this project was to put into practice lessons covered in course 4 as part
of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program. In this project, I wrangled the Twitter data
from @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs, and created analyses and visualizations that
can be used to draw reliable conclusions. The project is divided into three sections namely:
Data gathering, Data assessment, and Data cleaning. In the following sections, I will briefly
describe my effort to complete each of these tasks
